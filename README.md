## Trump Tweets

What was the President of the United States response to the pandemic?

○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
